His life undergoes a drastic change when a shinigami named Rukia Kuchiki crosses his path in search of a Hollow. During the fight with the spirit Rukia she is seriously injured and is forced to transfer part of her powers to Ichigo, who accepts the shinigami's proposal in an attempt to protect her family. However, during the transfer process, something goes wrong and Ichigo absorbs all of Rukia's powers, becoming a full-fledged shinigami. Having lost her powers, Rukia remains stuck in the world of the living until she regains her strength. Meanwhile, Ichigo replaces Rukia in her duties as Shinigami, battling the Hollows and leading the souls to the realm of the afterlife, known as the Soul Society. Over time, Rukia's superiors learn of her transfer of powers, which is considered illegal in the Soul Society, and sentence the shinigami to death. Although he is unable to prevent Rukia from being brought back to the Soul Society, Ichigo is preparing to save the girl, thanks to the help of his classmates. §_£% src/main/resources/img/data/bleach.JPG §_£% https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFPYnWV1Y-M
